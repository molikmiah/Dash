# Dash
This is the main repository for the Dash open-source web browser. This is a work in-progress project and is not ready for consumer use yet.
Dash is a web browser built for simplicity, performance and the modern web.

## Goals
The overall aim of the project is to build a modern open-source cross platform web browser which uses minimal system RAM, battery life and drive space.

**Target Platforms:** Windows 10, macOS, iOS (version TBD), Android (version TBD).

### Actions for achieving the goal

* Build using web technologies where possible for ease of development and cross-platform support
* Utilise the native browser engine from the host platform to promote web standards, competition and performance
* Focus on web content by reducing unecessary browser chrome and user interface elements
* Provide a familiar and optimised experience when running modern web applications on host platforms
* Embrace a modern design aesthetic populated with subtle animations
* Issue features and extensibility across all supported platforms
